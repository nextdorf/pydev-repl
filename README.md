# Pydev REPL

A Programmable REPL for Python Development

## Overview

Pydev REPL is a Python development tool that provides a programmable Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL) environment. It allows you to write and execute Python code in a interactive and dynamic way.

## Features

*   Programmable REPL environment
*   Supports execution of Python code
*   Dynamic code reloading and patching
*   Integration with Python's `ast` module for code analysis

## Installation

To install Pydev REPL, run the following command:

```bash
pip install pydev-repl
```

## Usage

To use Pydev REPL, simply import the `context` module and create a new context:

```python
from pydev_repl. import run

# Create a new 
ctx = run('my_contcontextext')
context
# Execute some code in the context
ctx.run('x = 5')
ctx.run('y = x * 2')
print(ctx.globals_of('y'))  # prints 10
```
